Dear Mr. Hancock,

My preferred topics are:            Matroids, Linear Programming, Matchings
The topics I could live with are:   Spanning Trees/ shortest paths, Travelling salesman, Knapsack problem

I am a Bachelors Math student. You can find my transcript of records attached to this mail.

For me, the idea of doing anything as efficient as possible, follows me through nearly all everyday tasks - but equally so doing things correctly and to the best of my ability. 
When I first came across the lecture "Algorithms and Datastructures" I noticed how it just perfectly fit my way of thinking. 
Since I now have learned quite about algorithms in general, I'd like to delve deeper into a specific topic and try to understand it so well, that I even can teach others about it. 
Through plenty of examples in my day to day life and through my studies, I have noticed, that only when you can fluently and elegantly teach a topic, that you've really understood it well. 
When reading in the book you have provided, I really liked how mathmatical the problems were presented and specified. That suits my background in mathmatics well.

In closing, I would very much like to take part in this seminar, to get the opportunity to take on the challenge of teaching a topic in a mathmatical way.

In closing, I would very much like to take part in this seminar, to get the opportunity of learning to teach a topic to my fellow students.

Best regards,
Joseph Holten
